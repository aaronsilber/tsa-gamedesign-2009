# Request #

Can anyone please do some tiny research on a method for simply modeling gravity, the curve of deceleration, etc.

We should delegate like, researchers for this.

# Details #

If you jump, gravity is constantly pulling on you at 1 g. You lose energy until you reach your highest point (weightless) and begin to be pulled back down by gravity.

# Further Research #

Please fill in here the actual math/etc:

a=t\*9.8

acceleration increases by 9.8 ft/s? But what's the ft/s^2 mean?

so, h=h+a?

t=1 second
a=9.8
h=9.8 ft high

t=2 second
a=19.6
h=29.4 ft high

but it's inverted. so this is actually the acceleration toward the earth freefalling ignoring air resistance.

for a jump:

there's the initial acceleration. ie maybe 20 ft/s.

acceleration = initial acceleration - gravity
a=i-g

height = previous height plus current acceleration
h=h+a

final height = previous height + initial acceleration - time in air **-9.8 fps
h=h+i-t**-9.8

h=10
i=20
t=1

h=10+20-1**-9.8
h=38**

h=38
i=20
t=2

h=38+20-2**-9.8
h=58-2**-9.8
h=58-(-19.6)
h=77

and, of course, the gravity should be 9.8, not -9.8.

I just calculated the height of what happens when you push yourself off a skydiving plane. Right...
